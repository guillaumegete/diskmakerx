# DiskMaker X for macOS Catalina

DiskMaker X (https://diskmakerx.com) was my pet project for many years, but the difficulty to maintain it properly became bigger as Apple made inter-app communication much more difficult (i.e. privacy stuff, which is good, BTW !).

Here lies the source code of the project. Feel free to tinker with it.


### Important stuff

As you may (or not) know, Applescript support in Github is a bit tricky. As I did not use Xcode to develop DiskMaker X but rather the excellent Script Debugger from Late Software (https://www.latenightsw.com), it may be difficult to re-compile the app directly. 

So be aware that [the main.applescript file](https://github.com/guillaumegete/diskmakerx/blob/main/Scripts/main.applescript) in the project should be renamed _main.scpt_ to properly use it directly with Script Debugger or Script Editor. 

Also, I do not provid the main icon for the app, which remains my property because it's so cute. Please bring your own stuff :-)
